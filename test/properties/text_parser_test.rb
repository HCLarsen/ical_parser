    DURATION:PT1H
    DESCRIPTION: We'll continue with the unfinished business from last time,
     in particular:
       Can names dtstart with a number?
       What if they are all numeric?
       Reuse of names - is it valid
     I remind the attendees we have spent 3 months on these subjects. We need
     closure!!!
